# Quantis State

## Current Position
- **Milestone**: v3.0 — Superpowers Integration & Antigravity 2.0
- **Phase**: 2 — Workflow Reconciliation (COMPLETE ✅)
- **Task**: All Phase 2 tasks complete + gap closure done
- **Status**: Paused at 2026-05-23T19:25

## Last Session Summary
Executed Phase 2 (Workflow Reconciliation) — wired all Quantis workflows to use Superpowers skills.

### Wave 1: Copied workflows, created aliases, added bootstrap files
- 29 workflows copied to `quantis-new/.agent/workflows/`
- 7 thin aliases created (plan, execute, map, discuss-phase, stress-test, research-phase, update-plan)
- `.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `adapters/`, root files, templates, CONSTITUTION.md

### Wave 2: Rewired skill-enhanced workflows + cleanup
- `/debug` → systematic-debugging, `/verify` → verification-before-completion, `/new-project` → brainstorming
- Updated `/help` with 3 categories (skill-powered, skill-enhanced, process-only)
- Updated `using-quantis` bootstrap table
- Added state hooks to `executing-plans` and `SDD` skills
- Cleaned all stale `superpowers` path references in skills

### Gap Closure: Thickened 7 aliases
- Identified that 20-line thin aliases lost Quantis process management (planning lock, waves, discovery levels, etc.)
- Thickened all 7 on branch `fix/thicken-workflow-aliases`:
  - plan.md: 22→131 lines (planning lock, research, checker)
  - execute.md: 23→134 lines (wave orchestration, gap closure)
  - stress-test.md: 23→111 lines (7-dimension framework)
  - discuss-phase.md: 23→68, research-phase.md: 22→96, update-plan.md: 23→83, map.md: 19→60
- Merged to main

### Key insight
Superpowers skills are complete methodologies — they don't need Quantis process management to work. The Quantis orchestration (planning lock, waves, state tracking, banners) is nice-to-have process discipline on top.

## Skill Changes in Phase 2
Only path renames (`superpowers→quantis`) and appended state hooks. Zero methodology changes to Superpowers skills.

## Decisions Made This Session
- D-031: In-place upgrade via MANIFEST.md — upgrade script uses manifest to know what's core vs user-installed

## Uncommitted Changes
None — everything committed and merged to main.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 3` — Phase 3: Integration Testing & Polish
   - Create `MANIFEST.md` listing core skills/workflows
   - Create `/upgrade` workflow for in-place GSD→v3.0 migration
   - Update `/install` and `/update` workflows
   - Update README with v3.0 architecture
   - End-to-end testing
2. `/execute 3` — Final phase
3. Tag v3.0 release
