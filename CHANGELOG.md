### 🔌 Subagent Skill-Wiring & Workflow Reliability

The central theme: a dispatched subagent is a fresh context that inherits none of the orchestrator's loaded skills, so every dispatch must hand the subagent its methodology skill by path. Plus the Phase 3.1 reliability remediation lands.

#### Added
- **Dispatch Contract (D-011)**: every subagent dispatch hands its methodology skill by path — `REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Read and follow .agents/skills/<X>/SKILL.md` — never pasted skill text (documented in QUANTIS-STYLE).
- **`scripts/validate-dispatch.sh`** — enforces the contract (no bare dispatchers; allow-list with reasons); wired into `validate-all.sh`.
- **TDD wired into execution**: the SDD `implementer` and `executing-plans` now force-load `test-driven-development`; `spec-reviewer` → `verification-before-completion`; `code-quality-reviewer` → `requesting-code-review`.
- **Methodology handed to dispatched subagents** in `wf-stress-test`, `wf-research-phase`, `wf-debug-issue`, `wf-audit-milestone`; `wf-plan-milestone-gaps` → `writing-plans`; `wf-sprint` → SDD.

#### Changed
- **All skill commands prefixed `/wf-`** (e.g. `/wf-plan`, `/wf-execute`) — workflows now suggest the correct CLI command names.
- **Gather→Digest→Generate**: the plan-writer now reads the change's full *blast radius* (files it edits **and** what those connect to), not just edited files (D-010).
- `writing-plans` IDE fallback reconciled to D-002: `/wf-execute` always uses subagent-driven-development (self-selects real subagents or inline by platform); `executing-plans` is standalone/separate-session only.

#### Fixed
- **Phase 3.1 workflow reliability remediation** — full audit fix set across the discuss→plan→execute→verify core (STOP gates, unified phase-dir resolution, completion ownership, per-task verify gate).
- Removed a verbatim-paste anti-pattern in `wf-stress-test`'s fan-out dispatch.
- `validate-dispatch.sh` now ships via `install.sh` / `upgrade.sh` and is listed in `MANIFEST.md`.

## [3.3.0] — 2026-06-11

### 🎉 CLI-First Migration

**BREAKING**: `.agent/workflows/` directory removed — all workflows now live in `.agents/skills/wf-*/SKILL.md`.

#### Added
- Platform compatibility matrix (IDE, CLI, Standalone) in `adapters/ANTIGRAVITY.md`
- Capability-based platform detection (no hardcoded platform names)
- Subagent dispatch for all major workflows: discuss-phase, plan, stress-test, execute, verify
- CLI quick start section in README
- `/wf-` prefix documentation in `/quantis-help`

#### Changed
- SDD is now the **default** execution path (CLI-first); IDE gets inline fallback
- `wf-execute`: deterministic SDD selection, no user menu
- `wf-verify`: `browser_subagent` graceful fallback when unavailable
- `wf-install`: updated paths for unified structure
- All root docs updated: PROJECT_RULES, QUANTIS-STYLE, MANIFEST, README
- Scripts updated: validate-workflows.sh, install.sh, upgrade.sh

#### Removed
- `.agent/workflows/` directory (workflows moved to `.agents/skills/wf-*/`)
- 30 `wf-*` symlinks replaced with real files
